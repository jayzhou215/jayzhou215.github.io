1. [detail](2021-05-11-atomic_cn.md) for atomic
2. cond 
```
// Cond implements a condition variable, a rendezvous point
// for goroutines waiting for or announcing the occurrence
// of an event.
//
// Each Cond has an associated Locker L (often a *Mutex or *RWMutex),
// which must be held when changing the condition and
// when calling the Wait method.
//
// A Cond must not be copied after first use.
```
3. map
```
// Map is like a Go map[interface{}]interface{} but is safe for concurrent use
// by multiple goroutines without additional locking or coordination.
// Loads, stores, and deletes run in amortized constant time.
//
// The Map type is specialized. Most code should use a plain Go map instead,
// with separate locking or coordination, for better type safety and to make it
// easier to maintain other invariants along with the map content.
//
// The Map type is optimized for two common use cases: (1) when the entry for a given
// key is only ever written once but read many times, as in caches that only grow,
// or (2) when multiple goroutines read, write, and overwrite entries for disjoint
// sets of keys. In these two cases, use of a Map may significantly reduce lock
// contention compared to a Go map paired with a separate Mutex or RWMutex.
//
// The zero Map is empty and ready for use. A Map must not be copied after first use.
