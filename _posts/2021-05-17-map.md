### map.go
```
// Map is like a Go map[interface{}]interface{} but is safe for concurrent use
// by multiple goroutines without additional locking or coordination.
// Loads, stores, and deletes run in amortized constant time.
//
// The Map type is specialized. Most code should use a plain Go map instead,
// with separate locking or coordination, for better type safety and to make it
// easier to maintain other invariants along with the map content.
//
// The Map type is optimized for two common use cases: (1) when the entry for a given
// key is only ever written once but read many times, as in caches that only grow,
// or (2) when multiple goroutines read, write, and overwrite entries for disjoint
// sets of keys. In these two cases, use of a Map may significantly reduce lock
// contention compared to a Go map paired with a separate Mutex or RWMutex.
//
// The zero Map is empty and ready for use. A Map must not be copied after first use.
```        

### map_reference_test.go

```
// RWMutexMap is an implementation of mapInterface using a sync.RWMutex.

// DeepCopyMap is an implementation of mapInterface using a Mutex and
// atomic.Value.  It makes deep copies of the map on every write to avoid
// acquiring the Mutex in Load.


```


### map_test.go
1. `TestMapMatchesRWMutex()` want to say sync.Map is functionally equal to `RWMutexMap`.
2. `TestMapMatchesDeepCopy()` want to say sync.Map is functionally equal to `DeepCopyMap`.

[for quick test in GoLand](../go_study/concurrency_study/map_test.go), just copy sync.map_reference_test.go and map_test.go 

```go
func TestMapMatchesRWMutex(t *testing.T) {}
func TestMapMatchesDeepCopy(t *testing.T) {}
func TestConcurrentRange(t *testing.T) {}
```
