# map
Hash Table is a data structure to map key to values (also called Table or Map Abstract Data Type/ADT). 
It uses a hash function to map large or even non-Integer keys into a small range of Integer indices (typically [0..hash_table_size-1]).

Hashing is an algorithm (via a hash function) that maps large data sets of variable length, called keys, not necessarily Integers, into smaller Integer data sets of a fixed length.

## Table
A Table ADT must support at least the following three operations as efficient as possible:

Search(v) — determine if v exists in the ADT or not,
Insert(v) — insert v into the ADT,
Remove(v) — remove v from the ADT.
